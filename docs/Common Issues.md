# Common Issues

## Upgrade failures

If you see the following error when upgrading:

```
ERROR: release_handler:check_install_release failed: {'EXIT',
                                                      {{badmatch,
                                                        {error,beam_lib,
                                                         {missing_chunk,
                                                          ...}]
```

Then the currently installed version had its debug information stripped via
`strip_debug_info: true` in the release configuration. Distillery will print a
warning when you build an upgrade with that setting set to `true`, because this
is what happens when you try to upgrade a release which has had its BEAMs
stripped. To fix this, you will need to stop the currently running release and
extract the tarball over the top of the release root directory, then start the
release again. To prevent this from happening in the future, set
`strip_debug_info: false` when using hot upgrades.
